DataSift API
============

This is the new Java library for accessing DataSift. See the tests and examples folder for some simple usage.
This version of the library is currently in alpha. It is incompatible with older versions. If you used a 2.x.x or lower version of the library then we have written a migration guide to help the transition.
See [MIGRATING_TO_V-3.0.0.md](MIGRATING_TO_V-3.0.0.md)

Requirements
------------

The following libraries are required [Netty](http://netty.io), [Higgs.IO](http://higgs.io), [HighScale lib](https://github.com/boundary/high-scale-lib) and JUnit for testing.
